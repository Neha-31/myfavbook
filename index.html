			<b></b> Stephen Mitchell is widely known for his ability to make ancient masterpieces 
			thrillingly new, to step in where many have tried before and create versions that are definitive for our time. He now brings to the Bhagavad Gita his gift for 
			breathing new life into sacred texts.<br>
			The Bhagavad Gita is universally acknowledged as one of the world’s literary and spiritual masterpieces. It is the core text of the Hindu tradition and has been
			 treasured by American writers from Emerson and Thoreau to T. S. Eliot, who called it the greatest philosophical poem after the Divine Comedy. There have been more 
			 than two hundred English translations of the Gita, including many competent literal versions, but not one of them is a superlative literary text in its own right.

	<h1> 2.Man's Search For Meaning </h1>

		<div class="para"><p>Man's Search for Meaning is a 1946 book by Viktor Frankl chronicling his experiences as a prisoner in Nazi concentration camps during World War II, 
			and describing his psychotherapeutic method, which involved identifying a purpose in life to feel positive about, and then immersively imagining that outcome.
			The sort of person the concentration camp prisoner became was the result of an inner decision and not of camp influences alone. Frankl came to believe man's deepest 
			desire is to search for meaning and purpose. This outstanding work offers us all a way to transcend suffering and find significance in the art of living.<br><br>

		<h1> 5.The Rudest Book Ever </h1>
		<img src="the rudest book ever.jpg " class="image">
		</a>
		<div class="para"><p>
			The Rudest Book Ever by Shwetabh Gangwar tries to bring a fresh perspective on how we see the world. It puts emphasis on why one should focus on learning how to think rather
			 than learning what to think. Also, it teaches why understanding your “self” is crucial in dealing with common problems like rejection.<br><br>
			 This book does not mean to teach. It is written to make you think, which is why the charged language, the book title, and the harsh approach. Although
			 the book does preach a whole lot, all I want from you is to think about it.<br>
